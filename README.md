# Bonjour and welcome! 👋👋

I'm Jason (@jaz-on) and I am a full remote WordPress hobbyist working at [Whodunit](https://www.whodunit.fr/) webagency, advising large companies on their website maintenance strategies. I live in the West of France in the charming town of Cognac! 🥃🇫🇷

I'm also a [WordPress contributor](https://profiles.wordpress.org/jaz_on/), [meetup La Rochelle organiser](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/wordpress-la-rochelle/), [Wordpress.tv](https://wordpress.tv) moderator, [WordCamp Europe](https://europe.wordcamp.org/) organiser, ...
I'm maintaining the following plugin as a hobby: [Weather Station](https://wordpress.org/plugins/live-weather-station/) and I'm also blogging on [my site Jasonrouet.com](https://jasonrouet.com/).

I am an avid SF reader, RP gamer as well. Interested in building fictional universes. Strongly pro-European. 🇪🇺 And of course, I’m also a fan of craftbeers 🍻 and coffee beans ☕️ addict!

My opensource contribution motto is the following:
