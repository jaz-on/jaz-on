# Bonjour and welcome! 👋👋

I'm Jason (@jaz-on) and I am a full remote WordPress hobbyist working at [Whodunit](https://www.whodunit.fr/) webagency, advising large companies on their website maintenance strategies.
I currently live in the West of France in the charming town of Cognac! 🥃🇫🇷

I'm also a [WordPress contributor](https://profiles.wordpress.org/jaz_on/), [meetup La Rochelle organiser](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/wordpress-la-rochelle/), Wordpress.tv moderator, ...
I'm maintening the following as a hobby: [Weather Station](https://wordpress.org/plugins/live-weather-station/) and I'm also bloging on [my site Jasonna.de](https://jasonna.de/).

Since June 2023, I'm the owner and maintainer of the [Live Weather Widget WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/live-weather-station/). The plugin as since been migrated from SVN to [its own Github repository here](https://github.com/Weather-Station-Software/live-weather-station)!

I am an avid SF reader, RP gamer as well. Interested in building fictional universe. Strongly pro-European. And of course, I’m also a fan of craftbeers and coffee beans addict!

See ya! 🤝
